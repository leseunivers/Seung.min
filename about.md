ESMNCE is a combination of 'ESSENCE' and 'SEUNG MIN'. I focus on what is genuine. Through this, I can live the life I desire and view the world with joy and delight. I donâ€™t want to live a life filled with regrets. The fact that death will come someday motivates me to do my best. Sometimes, I am so focused on the present that I feel afraid of the future. When I write down my intense emotions and turn them into something meaningful, my mind feels at ease. I want to document the journey of my life here and share it with you guys.
