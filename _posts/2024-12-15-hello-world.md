<h2> New update from <a href="https://www.a-propagator.com"> www.a-propagator.com </a></h2>

I just want to do my best to finish the website design until the very end. Physics doesn’t suit me. Following the physics curriculum for a year has been challenging. The longer I stay in college, the more I feel like I want to leave. It seems like my true self is not being recognized here. I feel like I can’t fully realize my potential in this place. I want to go where I truly belong.
