This is the design of the early A-propagator website from nine months ago. There has been significant progress compared to the present. At first, I was planning to create a website for Ajou University. The initial design of the A-propagator was based on the college web design. After my friend created A-propagator, there was no reason not to use the initial web design on a-propagator.com

I'm about to have a part-time job interview at a company called Etners. I'm so nervous and I can feel the pressure. At the last moment, I thought about not going to the interview at all. Because there is no absolute reason to have a part-time job. But for my future, it would be great to do it. "JUST DO IT."
